## Biography

I was born on 21 Mar 1983. I fell in love with programming when I was high school student. I studied **Mathematics** at university and I graduated MSc Mathematics with my dissertation on Wavelets on graphs via spectral graph theory. I specialize in the fields of object-oriented programming, data modeling, software analysis and implementation of complex algorithms, and implementation of modern design patterns.

## Job Objective 

Looking for a job position in an experienced team in a **.NET based** software company to apply my experiences in **designing**, **developing**, and **coding** web applications and adding value to business.
